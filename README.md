# Trie

Trie is very basic datastructure.   
I'm sure i would find better implementations.  
But this project is for me to learn zig and try to optimize this structure as i can.

ToDo:
- add function for calculating memory usage

## Tests

For each version run 5 tests.  
Here are test results (time(uS) and memory footprint(Bytes)).   
I'm hoping future versions will be better and better.
