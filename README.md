# Trie

Trie is very basic datastructure.   
I'm sure i would find better implementations.  
But this project is for me to learn zig and try to optimize this structure as i can.

ToDo:
- add function for calculating memory usage

## Tests

For each version run all tests 5 times. 
For performance tracking is used test "Mainly performance oriented test"  
Here are test results (time(uS) and memory footprint(Bytes)).   
I'm hoping future versions will be better and better.

|       |Time  |      |      |      |      |      |Memory |
